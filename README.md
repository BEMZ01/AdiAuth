# AdiAuth
<br>
<h2>A <b>free</b> hybrid auth plugin for bungeecord</h2>
<br><br>
It automatically logs in premium players, only cracked players need to login manually
<br><br>
It is very simple to use, Just put the plugin in your bungeecord server, configure the mysql database and then put it in your backend servers as well
<br><br>
It also has a lot of configurable options in the config.yml in bungeecord
There is no config for the backend servers, everything can be configured directly in the bungeecord server reducing a lot of hassle for all server owners :smile:

<h3>More features will be added soon!</h3>
